                      Brinster</strong><br>
              Ralph L. Brinster was raised on a farm in New Jersey and studied
                  agriculture and animal development while a student at Rutgers
                  University. Following
                military service during the Korean War, he attended the
                  University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine where
                  he became interested
                in germ cell biology, which influenced the direction of his scientific
                career. Since graduation, Dr. Brinster has been a pioneer in
                  this field and established innovative approaches to understand
                  the development
                and differentiation of germ cells and early embryos. His contributions
                include methods to culture and manipulate fertilized eggs and
                  spermatogonial stem cells, which laid the foundation for such
                  powerful techniques
                as transgenesis, cloning, in vitro fertilization, and stem cell
                transplantation. His experiments with transgenic mice dramatically
                altered our understanding of gene regulation and function in
                  animals. Dr. Brinster is a member of the National Academy of
                  Sciences and
                has been recognized by a number of international awards including
              the 2003 Wolf Prize in Medicine.</p>

              and came to the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 as associate
              dean for academic affairs, with the rank of associate professor.
              Dr. Buchanan&#8217;s research began in the area of gene expression,
              and more recently her research has focused on topics within education
              related to advanced simulation technology, learning styles, and
              the impact of computer literacy on learning. She has received funding
              from NIH and HRSA. Dr. Buchanan has served
              on numerous national committees including NIH study sections, the
              ADA Commission on Accreditation, and the ADA Commission on Improving
              Access to Oral Health Care for All Americans. She has also served

                team of scholars in a program of research designed to enhance
                the quality of life of vulnerable older adults and their caregivers.
                Findings from NIH-funded randomized clinical trials testing a
                model of discharge planning and home follow-up by advanced practice
                nurses have consistently demonstrated improved health outcomes
                and decreased costs for high risk cognitively intact elders compared
                to standard care. Supported by the Commonwealth Fund and the
                Langeloth Foundation and in partnership with a major insurer,
                efforts are underway to promote widespread adoption of this evidence-based
                model of care coordination. As part of Penn&#8217;s Marian S.
                Ware Alzheimer Program, Dr. Naylor is leading a team of clinical
                scholars in the implementation and evaluation of a similar care
                model aimed at enhancing the quality of care of cognitively impaired
              elders and their caregivers.</p>

             <p><strong><a name="weber"></a>Barbara L. Weber</strong><br>
             Barbara L. Weber is an international leader in the field of breast cancer
                genetics. She is a professor of medicine and genetics at the
                  University of Pennsylvania. She developed the Breast Cancer
                  Program at the
                University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center in 1995 and has served
                as the director since that time. In this capacity, she implemented
                and directs the Breast Cancer Risk Evaluation Program, a clinical
                service designed to provide comprehensive risk assessment and
                  counseling services to women with a strong family history of
                  breast cancer.
                This program was among the first of its kind in the world and
                  has served as a model for developing programs throughout the
                  US. Dr.
                Weber also is the director of cancer genomics at the University
                of Pennsylvania and has developed a program to fully utilize
                  the newly released human genome sequence for breast cancer
                  research.
                This includes enhanced microarray capabilities, with the addition
                of genomic clones for deletion mapping of tumors and premalignant
                tissue as well as enhanced sequencing and genotyping capabilities.
                Her ongoing research is focused on identifying genetic abnormalities
                that play a critical role in the initiation and progression of
                human cancer and that may serve as novel therapeutic targets.</p>
