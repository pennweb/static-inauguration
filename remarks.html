			<p class="bold">Distinguished presidents, delegates, honorable governor of

			  students, alumni, and revered guests, it is my great honor to welcome you
			  to the inauguration of Amy Gutmann as the eighth president and twenty-fourth
			  chief executive officer of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
			<p class="bold">This is an historic occasion for this august institution&#8212;America's
			  first university.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">The presence here today not only of our own eminent faculty&#8212;but
			  also of representatives of colleges, universities, and learned societies
			  from around the country and throughout the world&#8212;attests to Penn's
			  prominent place in the ambitious endeavor of higher education.</p>
			<p class="bold">An inauguration is heavy with the weight of all these traditions,
			  but it also represents a new beginning.</p>
			<p class="bold">On the one hand, the solemnity of these proceedings reflects
			  not just the traditions of presidential inauguration&#8212;it also symbolizes
			  the awesome responsibilities that Penn's president will bear for the well-being
			  of this community of scholars and learners and for its contributions to
			  society-at-large.</p>
			<p class="bold">On the other hand, the joyfulness of these proceedings symbolizes
			  our enduring love for this educational community&#8212;what my predecessor
			  at this podium ten years ago called "this idea called Penn."</p>
			<p class="bold">On behalf of the many diverse members of our community and
			  participants in this "idea," I thank you for being present here today to
			  share our great pride in our University, our boundless vision of its future,
			  and our reverence for and our joy at this event in our history.</p>
			<p class="bold">I am honored to present to you the following speakers who
			  bring greetings to President Gutmann from their respective constituencies:
			  Charles W. Mooney, on behalf of the faculty; Jason Levine and Simi Wilhelm,
			  on behalf of the students; Rodney Robinson and Sylvie Beauvais on behalf
			  of the administration and staff.</p>

			<p class="head3"><strong><em><a name="greetings"></a>Greetings</em></strong></p>
			<p align="left" class="bold"><strong>Charles W. Mooney<br>
            </strong><em>Chair, Faculty Senate</em></p>
			<p class="bold">Greetings from the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania.
			  We are delighted to welcome&nbsp; Dr. Amy Gutmann to Penn.</p>
			<p class="bold">The selection of Dr. Gutmann as president fulfilled our greatest
			  hopes. She brings to Penn impeccable credentials as a preeminent scholar
			  and outstanding academic leader. And she has the vision and energy to lead
			  us forward. </p>
			<p class="bold">The past decade has witnessed enormous successes for the Penn
			  community&#8212;our whole community&#8212;including our University City
			  neighbors. We look to the future with unflagging hope for continued success.
			  But hope alone will not suffice. Treading water will move us nowhere, even
			  backward.</p>
			<p class="bold">Not to worry. Dr. Gutmann has challenged us to step up the
			  pace. She has exhorted us to pursue our core missions of creating and disseminating
			  knowledge that will make the world a better place. She has challenged us
			  to stay the course of pursuing and preserving Penn's&nbsp; unique position
			  among the world's great research universities. And she has challenged us
			  to see that Penn plays an important role in fostering social justice and
			  democratic institutions.</p>
			<p class="bold">But as we pursue excellence and justice, we must always keep
			  intellectual freedom ringing within the Penn community. We believe that
			  vigorous debate and intellectual rigor thrive in an atmosphere of civility
			  and respect for one another. But as members of the diverse Penn community,
			  we are entitled to express our views and, yes, even to be wrong.</p>
			<p class="bold">Consider the following passage taken from Langston Hughes'
			  poem, <em>Democracy</em>:</p>
			<p class="bold">Freedom<br>
  Is a strong seed<br>
  Planted<br>
  In a great need.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  I live here, too.<br>
  I want freedom<br>
  Just as you.</p>
			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann, you have challenged us to rise to the challenges
			  of a diverse democracy. We the Penn faculty accept your challenges. We accept
			  them gladly.&nbsp; And we especially look forward to meeting them with you
			  as our colleague. Welcome to Penn.</p>
			<p align="right"><a href="#top"><img src="../images/returntop.gif" alt="Return to top" width="270" height="14" border="0"></a></p>
			<p align="left" class="bodytext"><strong> <a name="levine"></a>Jason A. Levine<br>
            </strong><em>Chair, Undergraduate Assembly</em></p>
			<p class="bold">On behalf of Penn's undergraduate students, I am honored to
			  welcome Dr. Amy Gutmann to this great University. As students, we wanted
			  a President who is renowned not only as a scholar, but as a leader and a
			  motivator. We found all of this in Dr. Gutmann.&nbsp; She has developed
			  a powerful vision about the contribution that universities can make to society
			  and democracy. I have met so many students who already feel a special connection
			  with Dr. Gutmann through her writings.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">As a leader, Dr. Gutmann brings new energy, optimism, and
			  inspiration to Penn. Her Inaugural theme, <em>Rising to the Challenges of
			  a Diverse Democracy,</em> recognizes many issues that we face today. In
			  just the short time she has been here, Dr. Gutmann has motivated students
			  to take on ambitious intellectual pursuits and serve in the community. </p>
			<p class="bold"> She has already shown her willingness to work with students
			  and listen to their opinions.&nbsp; Her warm smile encourages all of us
			  to speak freely. Dr. Gutmann, we undergraduates look forward to working
			  with you, learning from you, and thriving together. And when we beat Princeton,
			  perhaps we can coax you into helping us tear down the goalpost. Just kidding.</p>
			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann, the undergraduate community welcomes you wholeheartedly,
			  and we wish you health and happiness in your new post as president of the
			  University of Pennsylvania.</p>

            </strong><em>Chair, Graduate and Professional </em><em>Student Assembly</em></p>
			<p class="bold">On behalf of graduate and professional students across the
			  University of Pennsylvania, I would like to officially extend a collective
			  and warm welcome to our eighth president, Dr. Amy Gutmann.</p>
			<p class="bold">As the next generation of scholars and professionals, we need
			  a president who understands the appropriate marriage of practical and classical
			  instruction; we need a leader who can champion a vision for common academic
			  values across the professions and disciplines; we need a colleague who can
			  relate to the hours we pore over our experiments, case studies and journal
			  articles; and perhaps most importantly, we need a president who provides
			  a strong role model both as a scholar and as a professional institutional
			  leader.</p>
			<p class="bold">We are celebrating today because in Amy Gutmann, we have just
			  that president.</p>
			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann has embraced Penn's dual commitment to liberal
			  and practical education. Her vision for democratic education speaks to all
			  of us and her distinguished scholarly works inspire us to push the boundaries
			  of our own disciplines. In addition she exudes boundless energy and excitement
			  for this institution and our role in its eminent future.</p>
			<p class="bold">Lucky us and lucky Penn!</p>
			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann, on behalf of over 11,000 graduate students who
			  represent your new friends and colleagues, I welcome you to your new institutional
			  and scholarly home. Thank you for your commitment to preparing us for future
			  positions in which we can honor our Penn legacy and for providing an elegant
			  example of how to fulfill it.</p>

			<p class="bold">As you have learned from Professor Mooney, Jason and Simi,

			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann, we are grateful that you have taken the time
			  to get to know us. Encouraged by your vote of confidence in us, we have
			  rallied to your call to lead Penn to new heights of excellence. You can
			  count on our expertise and support to make your vision for Penn a reality.

			  exchanges at every level. The staff embraces President Gutmann, and we are
			  thrilled that an outstanding scholar of deliberative democracy has been
			  chosen to shape our campus culture into the 21st century.</p>

            </strong><em>Governor, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania</em></p>
			<p class="bold">Good morning everyone. When I applied to the University of
			  Pennsylvania in 1961, the fact that Penn was located in a large urban center
			  was not looked at as a plus, it was looked at as a negative. Why do you
			  want to go there with all the problems of the city? Why don't you want to
			  go to a pristine atmosphere where you can study and not worry about all
			  the attendant things that come from urban life in the early '60s? </p>
			<p class="bold">Well the world has changed and those changes have been reflected
			  in many places and Philadelphia is one of them, and now it is a tremendous
			  advantage, in my opinion, to go to college on an urban campus. The urban
			  centers are truly a laboratory for all the challenges that face our democracy.
			  Those challenges are great. Perhaps never in our lifetime have many of those
			  challenges been more acute. Over the last decade Penn had made enormous
			  progress in helping the City of Philadelphia and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
			  meet those challenges.</p>
			<p class="bold">We have seen a level of renewed activitism, renewed cooperation,
			  and renewed concern about the challenges that exist beyond the walls of
			  ivy. And when we learned that Dr. Rodin was leaving many of us thought, "Oh
			  my gosh are we going to go back?" You&nbsp; don't have to spend more than
			  five minutes with Dr. Gutmann to know we're not going back, we're going
			  forward at warp speed.</p>
			<p class="bold">You know I've always been described as someone with boundless
			  passion and boundless energy and I find that often to be the case, although
			  I do get tired. And after spending my first substantive meeting with Dr.
			  Gutmann, I was tired, I was tired. My energy and my passion was out-striped
			  in a few short moments. But it's wonderful to see that, because if you look
			  at the resources that we as a city, and we as a state, and we as a nation
			  have, to meet the difficult challenges it's never been more difficult. </p>
			<p class="bold">How do we address the rising costs of health care at a time
			  when people are living longer and longer lives? How do we deal with the
			  challenges of the new economy which inevitably involves transition, but
			  these are human beings you are transitioning out? How do we meet the challenges
			  that technology and science are putting upon us? And when you look at our
			  resources to meet those challenges, great universities&#8212;and I am proud
			  to say this is among the very greatest&#8212;are our strongest assets. But
			  only if they are led by leaders who have vision, compassion and who care
			  about making these universities even more drivers of economic progress,
			  of social progress, and of progress that will restore civility, decency
			  and quality of life for all of us as Americans. And for this challenge&#8212;this
			  challenge that will culminate I think in many intense and focused ways on
			  the morning of November 3rd&#8212;we couldn't have a better leader for the
			  University of Pennsylvania.</p>
			<p class="bold">Dr. Gutmann, congratulations to you and congratulations to
			  all of us for the great things that this University has accomplished over
			  the last decade, will continue, grow and will be more of a driving force
			  in helping us meet those challenges.</p>

			<p align="left" class="bodytext"><strong><a name="rhodes"></a>Frank H.T. Rhodes<br>
            </strong><em>President, American Philosophical Society</em></p>
			<p class="bold">On behalf of the nation's learned societies, I am pleased
			  to offer congratulations to Amy Gutmann on her inauguration as the University
			  of Pennsylvania's eighth president, and to commend the University of Pennsylvania
			  on its choice.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">Amy Gutmann is the ideal leader for Penn in the 21st century.
			  She is a distinguished scholar known the world over for her work in the
			  fields of political philosophy, ethics and human values. She has been widely
			  recognized for her research, teaching and writing on ethnic and cultural
			  pluralism, and I am pleased to note, as the representative of the learned
			  societies at these festivities, that Amy Gutmann is one of us. She is a
			  fellow of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National
			  Academy of Education. She is also a W.E.B. Du Bois Fellow of the American
			  Academy of Political and Social Sciences, and president of the American
			  Society of Political and Legal Philosophy. I take her active involvement
			  in these scholarly groups as a very good omen for the future of the learned
			  societies and for the future of Penn.</p>
			<p class="bold">For more than 250 years, the nation's learned societies and
			  the nation's universities have been partners in the search for knowledge
			  and in its dissemination, that is especially true for the University of
			  Pennsylvania and for the American Philosophical Society, which I have the
			  privilege to serve as president. Penn and APS both emerged from the fertile
			  mind of Philadelphia's "first citizen," Benjamin Franklin, the tercentenary
			  of whose birth Philadelphia will be celebrating in 2006. Both embodied Franklin's
			  practical, non-sectarian philosophy and his belief that education should
			  contribute to "the common stock of knowledge" as well as to the cultivation
			  of the "finer arts." And both benefited from his leadership and direct involvement
			  over many years. In fact, early in its history, the American Philosophical
			  Society provided space to the University of Pennsylvania in Philosophical
			  Hall; today there continues to be mutual dependence between the learned
			  societies and the major universities of the world. </p>
			<p class="bold">Here at the University of Pennsylvania, Franklin sowed the
			  seeds for what has become the basis for a liberal education all across America.
			  He envisioned a college that would teach "ornamental knowledge" and practical
			  skills; that would prepare students not just for the clergy, but also for
			  productive personal and professional lives across a wide spectrum of fields.And
			  in both the learned society and the University, Franklin helped foster an
			  international outlook. He himself had lived abroad at several stages of
			  his life. He was a member of the Royal Society of London and many literary
			  and scholarly societies on the continent. Several of the early members of
			  the APS were foreigners, including Lafayette, von Steuben and Kosciusko.
			  And that spirit of international inclusiveness infused his University, too.</p>
			<p class="bold">It is wonderful to see at Penn a true commitment to preparing
			  faculty and students for a world of growing global interdependence. And
			  to note that the commitment to nurturing a global perspective is poised
			  to increase dramatically under Amy Gutmann's leadership. Her vision for
			  Penn, as reflected in this afternoon's symposia, speaks both to the core
			  values of democratic societies and to the diversity of ways in which they
			  are expressed around the world.</p>
			<p class="bold">Quoting Ben Franklin: "either write things worthy of reading
			  or do things worth the writing." I predict that we can look forward to great
			  accomplishment in both those sphere from Amy Gutmann. On behalf of the learned
			  societies, I am privileged to convey congratulations to her and to the University
			  of Pennsylvania and to wish them both good success.</p>

			<p align="left" class="bodytext"><strong><a name="tilghman"></a>Shirley M.
			    Tilghman<br>
            </strong><em>President, Princeton University</em></p>
			<p class="bold">It is truly an honor for me to extend to Amy Gutmann the greetings
			  of her fellow college and university presidents as she formally takes the
			  helm of the University of Pennsylvania. We are delighted that this venerable
			  institution, whose founder, Benjamin Franklin, is synonymous with intellectual
			  curiosity, has had the wisdom to entrust its presidency to a scholar, teacher,
			  and leader of Amy Gutmann's stature.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">Of course, this occasion is also a true test of my character.&nbsp; For
			  after all, we gather to celebrate Penn's gain at Princeton's expense, a
			  circumstance that we Tigers try hard to avoid on every other occasion, and
			  most particularly at the Palestra. To all of us who had the great good fortune
			  to work with her over the past 28 years, Amy Gutmann will always be a true
			  daughter of Princeton, even though her colors are now red and blue.</p>
			<p class="bold">Amy Gutmann's qualities of mind and heart&#8212;her sense
			  of fairness and commitment to excellence&#8212;are ideally suited to the
			  challenges that Penn, and indeed all universities and colleges, will face
			  in the coming years. Let me highlight just two of these. The future vitality
			  of this country depends upon the doors of our institutions of learning being
			  held wide open for every qualified student, irrespective of their ethnic
			  background or their family's economic circumstances. This country faces
			  a paradox in education: we have arguably the finest system of higher education
			  in the world, but we are hampered by a K-12 system that is failing far too
			  many students, particularly in poor inner city neighborhoods and rural areas.
			  Attending an institution like the University of Pennsylvania is one of the
			  few ways in which a student from a disadvantaged background can achieve
			  social mobility in our democracy&#8212;but we know from experience that
			  such opportunities will not be available unless educational leaders are
			  committed to the principles of equal opportunity. Amy Gutmann's deep understanding
			  of this central issue of our time grows out of her lifelong scholarship
			  on identity and the value of multicultural education. </p>
			<p class="bold">Universities must also be champions for the free exchange
			  of ideas and independent inquiry in a democracy. That principle lies at
			  the very heart of what we mean when we speak of academic freedom. At a time
			  when our nation struggles to strike the right balance between preserving
			  the civil rights of the individual and the collective right of the population
			  to be secure, our colleges and universities need to be places where those
			  difficult debates, and others like them, can be conducted in a climate of
			  civility and mutual respect. We must teach a new generation of students
			  how to take part in civil discourse dispassionately and with due respect
			  for the facts and the convictions of others. As a brilliant political theorist
			  and moral philosopher, Amy Gutmann has written compellingly on the subjects
			  of freedom of association, human rights, and the value of deliberative democracy.&nbsp; As
			  a powerful teacher, she has led a generation of students to becoming informed
			  and effective citizens.</p>
			<p class="bold">If Penn is blessed in its choice of president, Amy Gutmann
			  is equally fortunate to be joining a University that has long embodied educational
			  principles that she has studied and articulated, principles that have helped
			  to define the character of higher education in America since pre-revolutionary
			  times. She can draw inspiration from Penn's motto: "<em>Leges sine Moribus
			  vanae"</em>&#8212;"laws without morals are useless"&#8212;and from the vision
			  of Penn's extraordinary founder&nbsp; In his <em>Proposals Relating to the
			  Education of Youth in Pensilvania</em>, published in 1749, Benjamin Franklin
			  argued that students should be brought to see that "true Merit" consists
			  of "an Inclination join'd with an Ability to serve Mankind, one's country,
			  Friends and Family." Penn's commitment to service, to the ethical pursuit
			  of knowledge, and to an inclusive definition of education, both in terms
			  of subjects offered and persons taught, will ensure that Amy Gutmann and
			  the community that welcomes her today will form a strong and fruitful partnership
			  for many years to come. Penn is a great University, and Amy Gutmann will
			  give new substance and expression to this greatness. If ever a marriage
			  were made in heaven, I like to think that this is it.</p>

			<p align="left" class="bodytext"><strong><a name="rudenstine"></a>Neil L.
			    Rudenstine<br>
            </strong><em>President Emeritus, Harvard University</em></p>
			<p class="bold">It is a great pleasure and honor to be here with you, to offer
			  greetings and congratulations on behalf of higher education in this country
			  and abroad.</p>
			<p class="bold">More personally, I am happy to be able to speak at a university
			  founded during the age of the Enlightment, when Scottish Anglicans, English
			  Quakers, and American Deists gathered together harmoniously to create this
			  institution, which began as a fragile charity school, transformed itself
			  into a burgeoning college, and then dashed ahead outflanking everyone else&#8212;to
			  become, in exactly 39 years, the first seat of higher learning in America
			  to be called a University.</p>
			<p class="bold">Because of your Enlightment founders, you chose to cultivate
			  the liberal arts, the advancement of science, and&ndash;most originally&#8212;the
			  beginning of serious study in the major professions (nearly a century before
			  others followed your lead).&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">These ambitious commitments involved, from the very start,
			  an unequivocal dedication to free inquiry, free expression, and the free
			  publication of a multiplicity of ideas and opinions.&nbsp; Much as you respected
			  religious conviction, you also made a bold proclamation of non-sectarianism,
			  and stated that you did not intend to become&#8212;like so many other colleges&#8212;a
			  training ground for the ministry.</p>
			<p class="bold">In charting this course, you may actually have succeeded more
			  extravagantly than you expected. Before long, there were fours times as
			  many publishers and printers in Philadelphia, freely circulating disconcerting
			  ideas, as there were ministers. And your commitment to the arts and sciences
			  swelled the ranks and quickened the exponential expansion in the number
			  of learned institutions that made Philadelphia the most intellectually conversable
			  city in America: institutions that ranged from the Athenaeum and the American
			  Philosophical Society, to the Academy of Natural Sciences, and an already
			  stunning Symphony orchestra that consisted, astonishingly, of 120 musicians
			  who apparently all played simultaneously as well as melodiously. </p>
			<p class="bold">Because the two universities where I have spent most of the
			  last half-century were established by unappeasable Puritans, who were inclined
			  to cast a cold eye on virtually all the fine arts, and certainly on any
			  potentially wayward philosophical musings; and because every time Princeton
			  chose a Jonathan Edwards as President, Harvard would call in a cheerless
			  Cotton Mather; and since the prevailing gloom that shrouded both of these
			  colleges made conventional run-of-mill Calvinists seem positively effusive,
			  if not hopelessly frivolous; you can perhaps understand what a revelation
			  it is for me to stand in the very center of an institution that did not
			  require a century or two of protracted excruciation in order to emerge into
			  the bright daylight that Benjamin Franklin and his colleagues obviously
			  took so easily for granted as part of their natural birthright.</p>
			<p class="bold">In short, the University of Pennsylvania was able to create&#8212;very
			  swiftly&#8212;a new conception of higher education on this continent: one
			  that was more daring in its intellectual openness and its reach, with an
			  extensive and adventurous curriculum that was as modern as it was classical;
			  and an approach to education that was concerned to encourage the practical
			  application of knowledge for the public good, as well as to pursue the discovery
			  of significant new knowledge, irrespective of any obvious utility that it
			  might have. Finally, you were more directly engaged with the creative, cultural
			  and enterprising life of your city than any other American college or university&#8212;something
			  that enabled both town and gown together to be distinctively and beneficently
			  urbane, rather than simply urban.</p>
			<p class="bold">For all that you have accomplished, the rest of us are here,
			  not only to bring greetings, but also to say how much we are in your debt.</p>
			<p class="bold">The most recent of all your clairvoyant deeds has been, of
			  course, the selection of your new president.&nbsp; You have chosen not only
			  wisely and well, but brilliantly. It would be hard for anyone to match the
			  extraordinary record of Judith Rodin&#8212;but, fortunately, there is no
			  need for competition in such matters.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">In President Amy Gutmann, however, you have found someone
			  who combines penetrating analytic ability, decisiveness with firmness, and
			  a capacity for strong and clear-sighted leadership.</p>
			<p class="bold">You have also chosen a person who motivates and energizes
			  others, bringing them together in a common enterprise, and doing so with
			  vivacity, resilience, great human warmth, and deeply humane values.</p>
			<p class="bold">Ethel Merman was once asked what she thought of another performer,
			  and promptly replied: "She's OK, if you like talent."&nbsp; Merman, of course,
			  was not merely talented&#8212;she was a show-stopper. Congratulations for
			  having selected, as your next President, someone who will be a leader for
			  all of higher education, and who is also&#8212;unambiguously&#8212;a show-stopper.</p>

			      of the President</em></strong></p>
			<p align="left" class="bodytext"><strong>James Riepe</strong></p>
			<p class="bold">I am very heartened by all of our speakers to know that we
			  made a good decision. Not having see their remarks, I was a bit worried.
			  It is a gray day outside but it is very sunny in here.</p>
			<p class="bold">I could not be more proud on this day when we invest Amy Gutmann
			  as Penn's eighth president&nbsp; She is the right person, at the right time,
			  in the right place.</p>
			<p class="bold">I was fortunate to have led the search committee that selected
			  Amy for this position, so I am admittedly biased. But I also had 20 fellow
			  search committee members and a full Board of Trustees, all of whom agreed.</p>
			<p class="bold">In our view, there could be no one better suited to lead this
			  institution forward at this moment in its history. No one more attuned to
			  the ideals of Benjamin Franklin's University.</p>
			<p class="bold">James Russell Lowell, a well-known American poet and author
			  in the mid19th century, once wrote that, "it was in making education not
			  only common to all, but in some sense compulsory on all, that the destiny
			  of the free republics of America was practically settled."</p>
			<p class="bold">Amy Gutmann's entire career as a teacher, scholar and moral
			  and political philosopher has been centered on the critical linkage of education
			  and democracy that is referenced in Lowell's comment about our American
			  democracy.&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">She has thought long and deeply about the ways education can
			  strengthen the institutions of democracy and now she will lead Penn to a
			  position of pre-eminence in precisely that vital charge&#8212;it is as though
			  her career was destined to put her in this place, at this time.</p>
			<p class="bold">Amy accepted our offer of this presidency with such enthusiasm
			  because she recognizes that there is no college or university in the world
			  better suited to rise to that ideal&#8212;from our first insitutional breath
			  under Mr. Franklin's guidance, we have sought to link theory and practice.
			  While many of our peers were veritable cloisters, Penn strove to educate
			  and train the citizens of a feisty little colony with a will to independence
			  and greatness.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
			<p class="bold">Thus, it is clear to me that today's marriage of Amy Gutmann
			  and Penn is a moment that was clearly meant to be.</p>
			<p class="bold">So it is now my great privilege formally to invest Dr. Amy
			  Gutmann as the eighth president of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
			<p class="bold">By the authority of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania,
			  I hereby invest you as president. This medallion is a symbol of that office.</p>
			<p class="bold">More than 100 years ago, Pennsylvania Governor Daniel Hartman
			  Hastings delivered these three keys to Charles Custis Harrison on his induction
			  as provost of the University.</p>
			<p class="bold">They, too, are emblems of the "authority with which you are
			  now invested and the solemn responsibilities laid upon you."</p>
			<p class="bold">With these keys, symbols of the custodianship of this great
			  University, I entrust the University of Pennsylvania to your sure leadership.</p>
			<p class="bold">Congratulations.</p>
